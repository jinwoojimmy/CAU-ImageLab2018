# 29/06/18 Meeting Note

## Meeting with Professor
All the undergraduate research students met professor, and discussed about what is being done and what to do among the vacation.
Based on each student's plan and suggestion, task was allocated.

- Me :
  As graduation is planned on next year February, development of practical software rather than research was allocated.
  -> Utilizing deep learning library or optimized weights, development of android application such that capture object and classify or categorize like that.
