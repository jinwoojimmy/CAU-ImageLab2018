Undergraduate students and several graduate students in Image Lab gathered to hold a seminar.

Each undergraduate students prepared each section with selected paper chosen by individual preferences.

These are papers each students chose. Each students summarized the paper and then explained keywords extracted from the paper.

* Ki-Soo : [Survey on Semantic Image Segmentation Techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8389420/)

* Jin-Woo(Me) : [Every Picture Tells a Story: Generating Sentences from Images](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221303952_Every_Picture_Tells_a_Story_Generating_Sentences_from_Images)

* Jin-Woo(Jeon) : [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7478072/)
