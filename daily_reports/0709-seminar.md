## Seminar - 2nd

Undergraduate students and several graduate students in Image Lab gathered to hold a seminar.

Each undergraduate student prepared own section with selected paper chosen by individual preferences.

In addition, each student complemented last week's presentation by studying more on mis-understood part on last week. 


* Ki-Soo : Surveyed on all the **metrics** used on research. 
  - The term **metric** is method to calculate similarity between two objects.

  - When it comes to clustering, data is grouped into N group(N defined by input). The data in the same cluster shares common feature, and this feature is based on the similarity.

  - Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Edit distance, Chebyshev distance, Cosine similarity... etc.


* Jin-Woo(Me) : Surveyed on **MRF**
  - Introduction of **PGM(Probabilistic Graphical Models)**
  - Concept of **Bayseian Network**
  - Concept of **MRF(Markov Random Field)**
  
  
* Jin-Woo(Jeon) : Presented on [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf)
  - On last week seminar, there was a question on weak point of CNN. To clarify the weak point and find out the alternative, researched on **CapsNet**.
  - **CapsNet** was proposed by Geoffrey Hinton and used **Dynamic Routing** for solution.  


* Yeon-Ji : Presented on [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)
  - To complement last week's keyword, researched on **Batch Normalization**
